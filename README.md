# Programming Assignment (PA#0)

This assignment is **Not Graded**, and you are encouraged to submit it to instructors to figure out any issues with the submission system.

## Creating the Repository for Assignment

Once you accept the invitation for this assignment here <https://classroom.github.com/a/yzIaWeP5>, you will see a GitHub repository created with starter code.
The repository name would be *pa0-\<Your GitHub Username\>*.
You will use this repository to maintain your code. You should regularly check in your code here.
Your repository is the only way for the instructors to see your code before the submission.

## Git Commands

* Clone the repository for the first time `git clone https://github.com/ECE368DataStructures/<repo_name>.git`, for this assignment, the \<repo_ name\> is **pa0-\<Your GitHub Username\>**
* Add changes `git add <file names>`
* Commit changes to your local repository `git commit -m "meaningful message"`
* Often commit while your working on the problem (This step won't be necessary for PA#0).
* Push changes often to GitHub `git push -u origin main`
* Please don't push binaries, object files and temporary files. 
* Please keep your GitHub repository clean.

## Fun Task
* Your starter code contains `main.c`. 
* Edit that file to print "recursion rocks". 
* Add-Commit-Push changes to the GitHub repository.
* The starter code also contains a _Makefile_. 
* You can use `make` to compile and `./main` to run it. 
* You can clean the binary with `make clean`.
* Always check running your code on *ece grid* Unix system.

## Final Submission
* Deadline for this assignment is **June 17, 11:59 pm**. 
* On GitHub
  * When you are ready to make a submission, add a submission tag `git tag submission`
  * Push changes to GitHub `git push -u origin main`
* On BrightSpace
  * You have to make the final submission in BrightSpace. 
  * Your submission should be a zipped folder as follows
  * The folder should be named as **pa0_\<Your_Purdue_Login\>**
  * The folder should only contain the final `main.c`
  * Zip command `zip -r pa0_<your_purdue_login>.zip pa0_<your_purdue_login>`
* Please follow the naming guidelines to avoid issues with grading.
